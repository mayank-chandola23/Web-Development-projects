    <div class="design">Urban Wardrobe:</div>
    <br>	
	<p>What are the most common items in the wardrobe of urban wearer? It should be hoodies, t-shirts and sneakers. All these clothes are usually designed with some sort of slogan.  Urban means informal, but their might be some accessories, large jewelry, that gives a little bit of posh and bling to this street style. Urban youth is absolutely crazy about hats. They are designed for specific outfit. Men and women like those looser pants, but within years those precise cut urban pants changed. Shoes may vary, from heels to sneakers. If clothing choices and types of outfits are quite the same, every urban person’s difference and uniqueness can be seen in colours and through the shades. The basic is of course bright or black. Sometimes you may notice those who combine shades according to landscape, ass if they are trying to blend in with the street. Today even the best designers are going for urban clothes. However, the popularity of brands and designers changes rapidly. With urban culture also came the gangster fashion. It’s mostly oversized clothes and converse sneakers.  </p>
	<br>

	<div class="design">Personal attitude:</div>
	<br>
	<p>Urban clothing requires an attitude. But what is actually a genuine type of urban outfit and urban person? If a girl and a boy calls herself/himself urban, has urban friends and urban upbringing, she/he acts like he means it. They are those who fallow and those who dictates the trends of urban lifestyle. Those fashion dictators or leaders aren’t afraid of large-scale changes. The group of urban youth have their manifestation, somehow based on the leader. Sounds like political dictatorship? It’s just fashionable and urban attitude.  </p>
	<br>

	<div class="design">The beginning of urban movement:</div>
	<br>
	<p>Before urban clothing became a mainstream, it had it’s upbringing and birth period. With the verge of hip-hop and rap music genres in 1970′s New York, came the urban fashion and attitude. Thus the rise of urban brands and clothing companies started. Today the biggest hip-hop artists have their own life of urban clothing lines. Fans of these great artists began to fallow their sense of style. This is when the baggy shirts and “bling-bling” trends took other. It was a viral trend that even reached further continents like Australia, Asia and Europe. Youth in London and Japan were crazy about urban style and so they still are. </p>
