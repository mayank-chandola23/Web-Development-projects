		<p class="sectag text-big">Responsive Web Design</p>
		<p class="secsubtag text-small">Responsiveness as a concept of computer science refers to the specific ability of a system or functional unit to complete assigned tasks within a given time. For example, it would refer to the ability of an artificial intelligence system to understand and carry out its tasks in a timely fashion. It is one of the criteria under the principle of robustness (from a v principle). The other three are observability, recoverability, and task conformance. Responsive web design (RWD) or responsive design is an approach to web design that aims to make web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size to ensure usability and satisfaction.</p>

		<p class="sectag text-big">Challenges And Other Approaches</p>
		<p class="secsubtag text-small">Luke Wroblewski has summarized some of the RWD and mobile design challenges and created a catalog of multi-device layout patterns.[20][21][22] He suggested that, compared with a simple HWD approach, device experience or RESS (responsive web design with server-side components) approaches can provide a user experience that is better optimized for mobile devices. Server-side CSS generator implementation of stylesheet languages like Sass can be part of such an approach. Google has recommended responsive design for smartphone websites over other approaches.Although many publishers have implemented responsive designs, one challenge for RWD adoption was that some banner advertisements and videos were not fluid.</p>

		<p class="sectag text-big">Bootstrap (Front-End Framework)</p>
		<p class="secsubtag text-small">Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. As of December 2022, Bootstrap is the 14th most starred project (4th most starred library) on GitHub, with over 161, stars. According to W3Techs, Bootstrap is used by 19.2% of all websites. Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project.</p>
